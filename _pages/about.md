I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at the Johns Hopkins University 
(JHU). My advisors are Prof. Ren√© Vidal and Prof. Donald Geman. Before JHU I did my MS in Computational Natural Sciences and B.Tech in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, India.


My current research is on developing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms who decision-making process can be explained to a human (who may not have prior experience with ML). As ML algorithms are deployed in critical decision-making areas like finance and healthcare, interpretability of these algorithms is essential! To know more about my work, visit Projects.

Apart from developing ML algorithms, I am also keenly interested in their application in biology. In the past, I worked on applying ML techniques to understand unfolding in protein and RNA moleculars from molecular dynamic trajectories. To know more about this work, visit Projects.
