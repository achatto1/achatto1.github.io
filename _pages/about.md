## About me
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at the Johns Hopkins University 
(JHU). My Ph.D. advisors are <a href="http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html">Prof. Ren√© Vidal</a> and <a href="https://www.cis.jhu.edu/people/faculty/geman/">Prof. Donald Geman</a>.\
**Ph.D. dissertation topic:** *An Information-theoretic Framework for Designing Interpretable Predictors*.

Before JHU I did my M.S. in Computational Natural Sciences and B.Tech in Computer Science from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabd (IIIT-H). My M.S. advisor was <a href="https://devalab.in">Prof. U. Deva Priyakumar</a>.\
**M.S. dissertation topic:** *A probabilistic framework for constructing temporal relations in Monte Carlo trajectories*.

## Research Interests
My current research is on developing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms whose decision-making process is human interpretable (users may not be ML experts themselves). As ML algorithms are deployed in critical decision-making areas like finance and healthcare, the interpretability of these algorithms is essential! To know more about my work, visit Projects.

Apart from developing ML algorithms, I am also keenly interested in their application in biology. In the past, I worked on developing ML techniques to understand the unfolding of biomolecules (proteins + RNAs) from their molecular dynamic trajectories. To know more about this work, visit Projects.
