## About me
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at the Johns Hopkins University 
(JHU). My Ph.D. advisors are <a href="http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html">Prof. Ren√© Vidal</a> and <a href="https://www.cis.jhu.edu/people/faculty/geman/">Prof. Donald Geman</a>.\
**Ph.D. dissertation topic:** *An Information-theoretic Framework for Designing Interpretable Predictors*.

Before JHU I did my M.S. in Computational Natural Sciences and B.Tech in Computer Science from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabd (IIIT-H). My M.S. advisor was <a href="https://devalab.in">Prof. U. Deva Priyakumar</a>.\
**M.S. dissertation topic:** *A probabilistic framework for constructing temporal relations in Monte Carlo trajectories*.

## Research Interests
My current research involves developing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that not only make accurate predictions but also provide human-interpretable explanations for their predictions (the users of these algorithms may not be ML experts themselves). Given that ML algorithms are increasingly being deployed in critical decision-making areas such as finance and healthcare, ensuring the interpretability of these algorithms is essential. For more information about my work, please visit the Projects section.

Apart from developing ML algorithms, I am also keenly interested in their application in biology. In the past, I worked on developing ML techniques to understand the unfolding of biomolecules (proteins + RNAs) from their molecular dynamic trajectories. To know more about this work, visit the Projects section.
